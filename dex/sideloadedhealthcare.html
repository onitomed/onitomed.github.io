                        <p>A sideloaded app is a mobile app installed from beyond the default App Store. Apps not found on Google Play Store or Apple App Store like Dream11 are installed by sideloading. In iOS, sideloading apps is done by app developers to test apps before release on the App Store. Sideloading apps needs jailbreaking otherwise.</p><p>When a system is broken yet cannot be shut down for replacement, a new system is built in parallel. Over time, the new system replaces the old system because it is better. This is the idea of sideloaded healthcare to fix broken health systems across the world. A new healthcare system running in parallel, with its own drug developers, hospitals, insurance, doctors and software. The fix to US healthcare is a sideloaded healthcare system, operating parallel to the existing shit nexus of insurers, hospitals and pharmacy benefit managers.</p><p>Healthcare is too expensive and broken in USA. Sideloaded healthcare fixes faults in existing healthcare but does not shut it down. Gradual replacement, not outright shutdown. Sideloaded healthcare has drug manufacturers, doctors and hospitals, operating independently of traditional health insurance. This system is out-of-pocket to simplify healthcare costs for providers and patients. This is already in use at out-of-pocket private practices, without health insurance coverage. Many doctors adopt this to fight back against insurers who refuse reimbursements for necessary patient care.</p><p><a href='https://onitomed.github.io'>ONITO</a> reimagines healthcare without the constraints of insurance reimbursement. Local primary and urgent care facilities, with long-term and chronic care offloaded to countries like India where healthcare costs are cheaper. In practice, quick cases treated in local hospitals and longer cases with expensive requirements (many medicines, expensive equipment, specialist doctors) are sent to India where healthcare costs are drastically lower. Simply put, accident, stroke and heart attack treatment in ONITO USA; cancer treatment and non-emergency surgeries in ONITO India.</p>
