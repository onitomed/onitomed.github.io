                        <p>Noorul Ali</p><p>B. Tech (computer science and engineering) from <a href='https://iiitvadodara.ac.in/#'>IIIT Vadodara</a> and MS (bioengineering) from <a href='https://www.tufts.edu/'>Tufts University</a>, Boston, United States. Noorul Ali developed the Python library <a href='https://pypi.org/project/humangemlib/'>HumanGEMlib</a> to visualize human metabolism under the effect of genetic variants linked to type 2 diabetes. He also developed <a href='https://matrixdex.github.io'>Protocol Dex</a>, an online repository of biotechnology lab protocols for easy citation and scientific reproducibility. He grew meat in a lab with the Kaplan Lab at Tufts University. <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/reports'>This cellular agriculture research</a> included quantification of the effect of curcumin as an antioxidant for bovine muscle cells, designing differentiation media for enhanced lipid storage in bovine stromal vascular cells (adipocytes) and optimization of alginate hydrogel as scaffold for cells in lab-grown meat. He serves as CEO and CTO of ONITO.</p><p>Noorul Ali is also the founder and CEO of <a href='https://asbldex.github.io'>ASBL</a>, a Boston-based biotechnology startup designing Automated Synthetic Biology Labs. ASBL combines drug research and manufacturing in one machine, upending existing drug economics. ASBL machines have a future use case in ONITO medical facilities.</p>
