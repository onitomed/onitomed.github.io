                        <p>Smart urine collection bag</p><p>PPBag is a smart urine collection bag for remote urine tests. PPBag version 1 has a digital screen. It displays and transmits real-time urine output on the PPBag screen and the patient's profile on ONITO.</p><p>PPBagV2 is a bioengineered urine collection bag (flexible bioreactor). It can do urine routine and urine culture tests at home.</p><p>PPBagV3 can do urodynamic study at home</p><p>PPBag transforms the existing paradigm of at-home urine collection, lab diagnostic tests and manual urine output measurement into one automated device to do it all. Automated urine output measurement, digital access to real-time urine output, at-home urine culture and routine tests, and at-home urodynamic study without specialists are features of PPBag to significantly improve patient experience for patients with a urinary catheter.</p><p>Patients with urine issues regularly need urine output measurement, urine routine test, urine culture test and sometimes urodynamic study test. Urine output data are measured manually today. Urine routine and culture tests require lab testing. Urodynamic study conducted at limited hospitals and require patient to physically go to the hospital.Regular urine analysis data required by urologists. Data quantifies medicinal effect but are difficult to collect at home. PPBag changes that with a brand new paradigm of urine analysis.</p>
