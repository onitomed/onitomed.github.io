                        <p>AI in healthcare</p><p>ONITO consolidates all medical data of a patient in one place. These include CT scans, MRIs, blood test reports and prescriptions. When all medical information are in one place, they can be accessed anytime, shared with doctors instantaneously, and used to predict diseases and improve accuracy of predictive models. This would allow doctors to access a patientâ€™s entire medical history at one place. A major goal of ONITO is to ease the workload of doctors by offloading as much as possible to AI, so that doctors can focus on what AI cannot do.</p><p>Modern patient data software</p><p>With AI models and medical data in one place, ONITO is a connected healthcare ecosystem. Medical data can be accessed by hospitals and clinics through APIs, with user consent. AI models exist on the same platform to assist in diagnosis. Demographic data by ONITO provides real-time knowledge on population health to government bodies while keeping individual patient data private.</p><p>ONITO allows users to access a wide variety of AI models at one place. Data for models to make predictions exists on ONITO. These are sent to AI models to generate disease predictions. Doctors and patients can get initial predictions to inform line of treatment. Each AI model is specialized in the diagnosis of a specific disease and they operate independently to determine diagnoses. ONITO is a central platform hosting many AI models.</p><p>Pre-diagnosis is a mission critical task. Verification and checks are done for each model, ensuring it performs the same on data the model has never seen before. Furthermore, models for the same disease compete with each other in terms of accuracy. One day, users will trust these models.</p><p>ONITO helps medical AI models come into everyday use. ONITO can use anonymized patient data for research. Models compete against each other in terms of accuracy for leaderboard ranks and monetary rewards. This provides incentives to researchers to make their models better using anonymized patient data. When data are shared, privacy is maintained by stripping it of identifying information (anonymization).</p>
