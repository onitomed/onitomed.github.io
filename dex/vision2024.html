                        <p>ONITO is in deep thought on how to reinvent healthcare for better patient outcomes. The need of the hour is a mathematical model insuring the duration of human life. ONITO experimented with machine learning-assisted doctors and <a href='dataprivacywithsecurecomputation.html'>privacy-preserving healthcare analysis</a>. We had a dream of bot doctors to alleviate the global shortage of doctors. We're experimenting with projects to chart a viable path toward that vision. We may never get there, because human life may be fundamentally unquantifiable. Healing a human may just need the human touch. Still, we strive.</p><p>ONITO's <a href='dataprivacywithsecurecomputation.html'>STDinfo secure computation protocol</a> prevents healthcare data breaches by keeping no unencrypted data on healthcare servers.</p><p>ONITO builds medical data infrastructure to help doctors. Our web application implements a view for predictive modeling of COVID-19 lung damage, pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmia. We implemented <a href='dataprivacywithsecurecomputation.html'>STDinfo</a> to maintain privacy of medical data. STDinfo is a Python script using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation'>secure multiparty computation</a>. ONITO makes medical inferences without reading raw medical data. In 2024, this was tested in checking whether 2 individuals are sexually compatible using their sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) medical test reports. Reports are not shared between parties nor with ONITO due to STDinfo.</p><p>Patient data in ONITO are fed into a pipeline of machine learning models to give disease predictions to doctors. A view of the machine learning pipeline with a backend capable of storing electronic health records was built by ONITO.</p>
